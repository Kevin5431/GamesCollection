In version 1 I created the main menu GUI to be able to select your game. This included making a frame adding buttons and action listeners. This is the start to being able to change the content on the frame to the desired game. 

In version 2 I will add all the content for the games themselves this includes the GUI for each game and the logic. I will also add what happens after a game is done and prompts the user for what they would like to do (Quit, Play Again or Select New Game). I will also give the random button its functionality. I will make some things visually appealing through the use of images.

I would like to add a fourth game of checkers but at the moment I think three is quite a lot and wouldn't be able to add a fourth game.
